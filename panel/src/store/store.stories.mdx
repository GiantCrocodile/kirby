# `$store` - shared data and state management

We use [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) to ensure a consistent state of data throughout the Panel.  
If you have not worked with Vuex before, you should first familiarize yourself with [their documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/).

```js
this.$store
```
